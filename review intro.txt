"Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Suresh Kumar, and I was responsible for the front-end development of the affective analysis project, which utilizes affective analysis to recognize emotions based on facial expressions and voice tones.

As a front-end developer, my role was to translate the design concepts into a functional website, using a combination of HTML, CSS.

 Throughout the project, I focused on creating a seamless user experience and optimizing the website for performance.

Throughout the project, I focused on creating a seamless user experience that guides the user through the process of recording audio , and recording video using live cam and simultaneously both audio and video.

 I'm excited to share our progress with you today and look forward to hearing your feedback."Thank you for your attention..
